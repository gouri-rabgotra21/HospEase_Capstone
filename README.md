## üè• Project Overview

HospEase aims to streamline hospital‚Äêside needs and patient interactions by providing:

- A web interface for hospital / admin staff to manage tasks (appointments, patient records, etc.).  
- A chatbot that can answer patient queries, provide information (hours, specialty, booking), etc.  
- Training & data processing scripts to keep the chatbot updated with relevant medical / hospital data.  

The goal is to reduce waiting times, miscommunication, and simplify patient hospital navigation.

## üîç Features

- Interactive web frontend (HTML / JavaScript) for user / admin access  
- Chatbot capable of understanding & responding to user queries  
- Data generation / training pipeline for chatbot: CSV data, scripts to generate / preprocess training data, and model training  
- Admin / user distinction for role-based access  
- Real-time or scheduled updates of chatbot responses as hospital data changes

## üèó Architecture & Components

- **index.html / JavaScript** ‚Üí The web UI for users / patients / hospital staff  
- **chatbot_training_data.csv** ‚Üí Dataset of sample interactions / questions & answers for chatbot training  
- **generate_training_data.py** ‚Üí Script to expand / preprocess raw data into formats usable for training  
- **train_chatbot_model.py** ‚Üí Script to train the chatbot model using processed data  
- **(Optional) Backend API** ‚Üí If implemented: endpoints that serve chat responses, patient info, etc.

# Step 1: Install required tools (Python 3.8+)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2: Prepare training data
python generate_training_data.py

# Step 3: Train the chatbot model
python train_chatbot_model.py

# Step 4: Run the web UI (open index.html in browser) 
# or host via simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000

# Step 5 (Optional): If a backend server is implemented
# configure environment variables, database, then run server

## Usage

# Patients can visit the web portal and ask health/hospital related questions through the chatbot.
# Admins can view/manage hospital details and adjust Q-A pairs used by the chatbot.
# Updating the CSV/data and re-training the model improves chatbot responses.

## Data & Training

# chatbot_training_data.csv contains training samples: user questions and expected answers.
# generate_training_data.py preprocesses/augments data (cleaning, normalization, paraphrasing, etc.).
# train_chatbot_model.py trains a ML/NLP model (rule-based or transformer/intent-classification) to generate responses.

## Contributing

# Contributions are welcome! You can help by:
# - Adding more realistic training examples (questions & responses)
# - Improving model accuracy or adding context awareness
# - Enhancing UI / adding features (appointment booking, notifications)
# - Refactoring code and improving performance

## Future Enhancements

# - Deploy backend with REST API for better scalability
# - Use a more advanced chatbot framework (e.g., Rasa, Dialogflow)
# - Add user authentication and role-based dashboards
# - Integrate with hospital databases for live data
# - Provide multilingual support
