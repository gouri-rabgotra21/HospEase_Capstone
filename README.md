## 🏥 Project Overview

HospEase aims to streamline hospital‐side needs and patient interactions by providing:

- A web interface for hospital / admin staff to manage tasks (appointments, patient records, etc.).  
- A chatbot that can answer patient queries, provide information (hours, specialty, booking), etc.  
- Training & data processing scripts to keep the chatbot updated with relevant medical / hospital data.  

The goal is to reduce waiting times, miscommunication, and simplify patient hospital navigation.
